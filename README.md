## Dependencies
For script simple-3msg: <br>
-> [modemmanager](https://github.com/freedesktop/ModemManager) <br>
For script 3msg: <br>
-> [modemmanager](https://github.com/freedesktop/ModemManager) <br>
-> [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) <br>

## Installation
You should add permission to execute (using `chmod +x`) the script, then run it normally `./filename`. <br>
<br>
If you want to use it "as command" the script needs to be executable, with: <br>
<br>

```bash
chmod +x scriptname
```

<br>
Also, you want the script to be located in a directory that is in your PATH. To see your PATH use: <br>
<br>

```bash
echo $PATH
```

<br>
Your choices are: to move (or link) the file into one of those directories, or to add the directory it is in to your PATH.<br>
<br>
You can add a directory to your PATH with:<br>
<br>

```bash
PATH=$PATH:/name/of/my/directory
```

<br>
and if you do this in the file $HOME/.bashrc it will happen for each of your shell's automatically.<br>
